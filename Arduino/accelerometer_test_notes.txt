MPU9250
Have to use either 1000 Hz (too low) or 4000 Hz with all 3 accelerometer axes with FIFO.
No watermark

Results: Can't keep up with downloading over I2C

LIS2DS12
Has magnitude mode
256-level FIFO
14-bit
1600, 3200, 6400 Hz
If using magnitude mode, still only get 256 samples because I think it uses 3 per time slot.

Operates at a lower voltage than microSD card
150 uA at 1.8V

KX126-1063
2048-byte buffer
8 or 16-bit resolution (683 sets at low res; 342 sets at high res)
1600, 3200, 6400, 12800, 25600 data rates
watermark
145 uA at 2.5V
Confusing: Spec sheet says "Additional data can not be written to the buffer while data is being read from the buffer using auto-increment mode."
But, bullet points say can read buffer while it is being written to
